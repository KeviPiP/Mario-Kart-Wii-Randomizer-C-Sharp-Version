Mario Kart Wii Randomizer made in C# with .NET Core 3.1

Note: This is a Command Line program, a GUI version will be coming soon. Once I figure out how to do it lol.

Download .NET Core 3.1 Runtime

https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/3.1/runtime

Features:

Note: This program assumes you have everything unlocked from both games!

Mario Kart Wii:

* Options to randomize karts only, bikes only, or both!
* Character randomizer
* Track randomizer

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe:

* Options to randomize vehicles only, gliders only, tires only, or all!
* Character randomizer
* Track randomizer

This is just something I did to get more used to the C# language.

Any constructive criticism is welcome, since I'm trying to get better at C# and programming as a whole.
